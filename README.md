<h3>Binary Search Tree</h3>
<h6>BinarySearchTree.py</h6>
<br/>
<p>Binary search trees are a great way to store data that needs to by searched through many times. While searching through a standard list as a data model, it is possible to traverse every
element before finding the target. With binary search trees, the amount of elements traversed will be closer to the log (base two) of the number of elements in the model. This happens
because at every node starting from the root, we use our (binary) comparison function to find out which way we need to continue down the tree, thus runling out half of the 
tree at each node. While the log(n) search time is not guaranteed, it will be very close. Later I will implement a new type of tree that will <i>always</i> be log(n) (AVL Trees)</p>
